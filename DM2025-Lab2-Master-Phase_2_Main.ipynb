    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "**At its core, love, from a psychological standpoint, is a powerful emotion characterized by a strong feeling of affection, attachment, and often, a desire for closeness and connection with another person.** But that's just scratching the surface. Here's a breakdown of some key psychological perspectives on love:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Attachment Theory:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Foundation:** This theory, pioneered by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, suggests that our early childhood experiences with caregivers shape our attachment styles, which then influence how we form and maintain relationships in adulthood.\n",
       "*   **Attachment Styles:**\n",
       "    *   **Secure Attachment:** Individuals with a secure attachment style tend to be comfortable with intimacy and autonomy. They trust their partners and are able to form healthy, balanced relationships.\n",
       "    *   **Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment:** These individuals crave intimacy but often worry about their partner's commitment. They may be clingy and fear rejection.\n",
       "    *   **Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment:** These individuals value independence and avoid intimacy. They may suppress their emotions and find it difficult to rely on others.\n",
       "    *   **Fearful-Avoidant Attachment:** These individuals desire intimacy but fear rejection. They may have difficulty trusting others and experience a push-pull dynamic in relationships.\n",
       "*   **Love as Attachment:** From this perspective, love is essentially a strong attachment bond that provides a sense of security, comfort, and belonging.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Components:** Robert Sternberg proposed that love is composed of three key components:\n",
       "    *   **Intimacy:** Feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness. It involves sharing personal thoughts and feelings, providing emotional support, and feeling understood.\n",
       "    *   **Passion:** The drive that leads to romance, physical attraction, and sexual consummation. It's the \"spark\" or intense desire in a relationship.\n",
       "    *   **Commitment:** The decision to maintain the relationship in the long term, through good times and bad. It involves loyalty, responsibility, and a shared vision for the future.\n",
       "*   **Different Types of Love:** Sternberg argued that different combinations of these components result in different types of love:\n",
       "    *   **Liking (Intimacy only):** Feeling close and connected to someone without passion or commitment.\n",
       "    *   **Infatuation (Passion only):** Intense attraction and arousal without intimacy or commitment.\n",
       "    *   **Empty Love (Commitment only):** A sense of obligation to stay in the relationship without intimacy or passion.\n",
       "    *   **Romantic Love (Intimacy + Passion):** Feeling close and passionate but without a long-term commitment.\n",
       "    *   **Companionate Love (Intimacy + Commitment):** A deep, affectionate bond with a strong sense of commitment but less passion.\n",
       "    *   **Fatuous Love (Passion + Commitment):** A whirlwind romance based on passion and commitment but lacking intimacy.\n",
       "    *   **Consummate Love (Intimacy + Passion + Commitment):** The ideal form of love, encompassing all three components.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Evolutionary Psychology Perspective:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Survival and Reproduction:** Evolutionary psychology views love as a mechanism that evolved to promote survival and reproduction.\n",
       "*   **Mate Selection:** Love helps us form strong pair bonds, which are essential for raising offspring and ensuring their survival.\n",
       "*   **Sexual Selection:** Passion and attraction play a role in mate selection, as we are drawn to individuals who possess traits that are considered desirable and indicative of good genes.\n",
       "*   **Parental Love:** The strong bond between parents and children is crucial for ensuring the child's survival and development.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Social Exchange Theory:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** This theory suggests that relationships are based on a cost-benefit analysis. We are attracted to individuals who offer us the most rewards (e.g., emotional support, companionship, resources) with the fewest costs (e.g., conflict, stress, sacrifice).\n",
       "*   **Equity:** We are more likely to be satisfied in relationships where there is a perceived balance of costs and benefits for both partners.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that involves attachment, intimacy, passion, commitment, and a desire for connection. It is shaped by our early experiences, our evolutionary history, and our social interactions. Understanding these different psychological perspectives can help us gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of love and how it influences our lives.**\n",
       "\n",
       "It's also important to remember that love is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person and across cultures. There's no single \"right\" way to experience love, and what works for one person may not work for another.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, it's worth noting that the study of love is ongoing, and researchers continue to explore the many facets of this fascinating emotion.\n"

       "Of course. Let's sit down and talk about this. From a psychological perspective, \"love\" isn't a single, mystical emotion that strikes like lightning. Instead, we see it as a multifaceted psychological construct—a complex interplay of biological, cognitive, and social factors.\n",
       "\n",
       "To truly understand it, we have to look at it through several different lenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. The Structural Lens: The Three Building Blocks of Love\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps the most famous psychological model is **Robert Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love**. He proposed that love is composed of three fundamental components, like the points of a triangle:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Intimacy (The \"Warm\" Component):** This is the emotional core. It involves feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness. It's the self-disclosure, the sharing of secrets, the feeling that you can be your true self with someone and be accepted. It’s the friendship at the heart of a relationship.\n",
       "*   **Passion (The \"Hot\" Component):** This is the motivational drive. It encompasses physical attraction, sexual desire, and the intense, often euphoric, feelings of romance. It's the physiological arousal—the racing heart, the butterflies in your stomach. This component is often most powerful at the beginning of a relationship.\n",
       "*   **Commitment (The \"Cool\" or \"Cognitive\" Component):** This is the decision-making part. In the short-term, it's the decision that you love someone. In the long-term, it's the commitment to maintain that love through challenges and time. It’s the conscious choice to stay with your partner and work on the relationship.\n",
       "\n",
       "Different combinations of these three create different *types* of love. For example:\n",
       "*   **Intimacy alone** is Liking (e.g., a good friend).\n",
       "*   **Passion alone** is Infatuation (e.g., a celebrity crush).\n",
       "*   **Commitment alone** is Empty Love (e.g., staying together for the kids).\n",
       "*   **Intimacy + Passion** is Romantic Love.\n",
       "*   **Intimacy + Commitment** is Companionate Love (the deep affection for those with whom our lives are intertwined, like a best friend or a long-term partner where the initial spark has faded).\n",
       "*   **Passion + Commitment** is Fatuous Love (a whirlwind, often short-lived romance).\n",
       "\n",
       "The ultimate goal, according to Sternberg, is **Consummate Love**, which contains a healthy balance of all three components.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. The Biological Lens: The Neurochemistry of Love\n",
       "\n",
       "Your brain on love looks very different from your brain at other times. We can break this down into three stages, each dominated by different neurochemicals:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lust (Attraction):** Driven primarily by sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen. This is the initial, primal drive for physical connection.\n",
       "*   **Romantic Attraction (Falling in Love):** This is where it gets interesting. This stage is characterized by a flood of a specific cocktail of neurotransmitters:\n",
       "    *   **Dopamine:** This is the key player in the brain's reward system. It's released when we do things that feel good, creating a powerful sense of pleasure and craving. The intense focus and energy you have for a new partner is driven by this dopamine rush. In brain scans, this stage looks remarkably similar to cocaine addiction.\n",
       "    *   **Norepinephrine:** This is responsible for the adrenaline rush—the sweaty palms, racing heart, and feelings of exhilaration. It enhances your memory for new stimuli, which is why you remember every tiny detail from your first few dates.\n",
       "    *   **Low Serotonin:** Levels of this neurotransmitter, which is associated with mood and appetite, actually *drop* during the initial phase of love. Low serotonin is also a hallmark of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which helps explain the obsessive, intrusive, all-consuming thoughts about your beloved.\n",
       "*   **Attachment (Long-Term Bonding):** For a relationship to last, the frantic energy of attraction must evolve into a calmer, more stable bond. This is facilitated by two key hormones:\n",
       "    *   **Oxytocin (The \"Cuddle Hormone\"):** Released during physical touch, orgasm, and childbirth, oxytocin promotes feelings of trust, calm, and deep connection. It's the social glue that helps form lasting pair-bonds.\n",
       "    *   **Vasopressin:** This hormone is also linked to long-term commitment and protective behaviors. Studies on prairie voles (who mate for life) show that blocking vasopressin can disrupt their monogamous bonds.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. The Developmental Lens: The Blueprint from Your Past\n",
       "\n",
       "**Attachment Theory**, pioneered by John Bowlby, argues that our capacity for and style of loving as adults is profoundly shaped by our earliest relationships with our primary caregivers. We develop an \"internal working model\" of how relationships work based on whether our needs were met consistently and lovingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "This leads to different attachment styles in adulthood:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Secure Attachment:** Individuals who had reliable caregivers tend to find it easy to be close to others, are comfortable depending on them and having them depend on them, and don't worry about abandonment. They see love as a safe, stable base from which to explore the world.\n",
       "*   **Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment:** Those with inconsistent caregivers may crave intimacy but are insecure in their relationships. They often worry their partner doesn't love them enough and can become demanding or \"clingy\" out of a deep-seated fear of rejection.\n",
       "*   **Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment:** Those with distant or rejecting caregivers may grow up to be fiercely independent. They are uncomfortable with closeness, see intimacy as a threat to their autonomy, and often suppress their feelings to keep partners at a distance.\n",
       "*   **Fearful-Avoidant Attachment:** A product of frightening or traumatic caregiving, these individuals simultaneously desire and fear intimacy. They are caught in a push-pull dynamic, struggling with trust and often finding relationships confusing and chaotic.\n",
       "\n",
       "### In Conclusion: What is Love?\n",
       "\n",
       "So, from a psychologist's viewpoint, love is not one thing.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is a **biological drive** rooted in our evolutionary need to reproduce and form pair-bonds to raise offspring.\n",
       "It is a **cognitive and emotional experience** built from intimacy, passion, and commitment.\n",
       "It is a **learned behavior** patterned on the attachment blueprints laid down in our infancy.\n",
       "It is a **conscious choice** to invest in and maintain a bond with another person over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Love is a dynamic process that changes over its lifespan—from the dopamine-fueled obsession of new romance to the oxytocin-based comfort of a long-term partnership. It is one of the most profound and complex human experiences, engaging every level of our being, from our brain chemistry to our highest ideals."

      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",

      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",

      "watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
